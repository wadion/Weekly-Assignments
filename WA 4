1. "Download the assembly for Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z2901 from NCBI using the NCBI e-utilities accession number CP000141.1"
2. Code: efetch -db=sequences -id=CP000141.1 -format=fasta>C_hydro.fasta

3. "Download the raw sequencing reads for Carboxydothermus ferrireducens from the google drive"
4. Code for read 1: gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWWO5wVRRThLBXXEZjyWZHIb9udVcnCS/edit C.ferri_R1.fasta
5. Code for read 2: gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZFvpSIctuBihkOlQX9vhrkxng3cRmvK/edit C.ferri_R2.fasta

6. "Use bowtie2 to map the raw sequencing reads to the reference (Z2901)"
7. Code to use bowtie2 to index my reference genome: bowtie2-build C_hydro.fasta C.hydro_WA4
8. Code to use bowtie2 to map the raw sequencing reads to the reference: bowtie2 -x C.hydro_WA4 -1 C.ferri_R1.fasta -2 C.ferri_R2.fasta -S WA_4.sam
9. This shows 27.22% aligned concordantly 0 time, 68.85% aligned concordantly 1 time, and 3.93% aligned >1 times. 74.52% overall alignment rate.

10. "Use Fastq to assess the quality of each of these files"
11. Code to download R1 raw sequences as .fastq: gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWWO5wVRRThLBXXEZjyWZHIb9udVcnCS/edit C.ferri_R1.fastq
12. Code to download R2 raw sequences as .fastq: gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZFvpSIctuBihkOlQX9vhrkxng3cRmvK/edit C.ferri_R2.fastq
13. Code to run FastQC on read 1: fastqc C.ferri_R1.fastq
14. Access quality data: file:///H:/BL5300/Weekly%20Assignments/WA%204/C.ferri_R1_fastqc.html
15. #### Is this a good quality run? --> Almost. All criteria pass except for the "Overrepresented sequences" section (which failed). Upon further review, it appears that there are leftover Illumina Paired End PCR Primer 2 sequences. Trimming is required to remove adaptors.
16. Code to run FastQC on read 2: fastqc C.ferri_R2.fastq
17. Access quality data: file:///H:/BL5300/Weekly%20Assignments/WA%204/C.ferri_R2_fastqc.html
18. #### Is this a good quality run? --> Almost. All criteria pass except for the "Overrepresented sequences" section (which failed). Upon further review, it appears that there are leftover Illumina Single End PCR Primer 1 sequences. Trimming is required to remove adaptors.

19. "Use cutadapt to remove adaptors"
20. Code: cutadapt -q 20,20 -a GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATATCGTATGCCGT -A CGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCG -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C.ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p C.ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq C.ferri_R1.fastq C.ferri_R2.fastq
21. ##### Note: I used the primer sequences from the initial fastqc file
22. Code to check the quality of my cleaned-up R1 sequence: fastqc C.ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq
23. Code to check the quality of my cleaned-up R2 sequence: fastqc C.ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq
24. The cleaned-up files (C.ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq and fastqc C.ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq) have no failures, but they each have warnings for the "Sequence Length Distribution" criteria. Locations of the files: "file:///H:/BL5300/Weekly%20Assignments/WA%204/C.ferri_R1.cutadapt_fastqc.html" "file:///H:/BL5300/Weekly%20Assignments/WA%204/C.ferri_R2.cutadapt_fastqc.html"
25. Read 1 with adapter -> 62,221 sequences (6.2%)
26. Read 2 woth adapter -> 33,021 sequences (3.3%)

27. "Use bowtie2 to map the C. ferrireducens read to the reference"
28. Code: "bowtie2 -x C.hydro_WA4 -1 C.ferri_R1.cutadapt.fastq -2 C.ferri_R2.cutadapt.fastq -S WA_4_final.sam"
29. 23.00% aligned concordanlty 0 times, 72.87% aligned concordantly 1 time, 4.13% aligned concordantly >1 times 
30. 78.64% overall alignment rate
