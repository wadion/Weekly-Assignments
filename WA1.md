1. wc -c *.fasta | tail -5 | > biggest_5_charachter_counts.fasta
2. This coummand line will (1) calculate the number of charchters in all .fasta files, (2) find the five .fasta files with the largest charachter counts, and (3) put them into a .fasta file called "biggest_5_charachter_counts"
3. So, the expected input is all the .fasta files and the expected output is a .fasta file with the largest five .fasta files
