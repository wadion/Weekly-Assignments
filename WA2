**Determine the number of protein sequences in the chloroplast.**
1. Code: "grep -c ">" coffee_chloroplast.fasta"
2. The result is 85 protein sequences

**Create a file of all of the names of protein sequences in Coffee plant's chloroplast sequences.**
1. Code: "grep -h ">" coffee_chloroplast.fasta >coffee_chloroplast_sequences.fasta"
2. The result is a file named "coffee_chloroplast_sequences.fasta" that lists the names of all the protein sequences in a coffee plant's chloroplast

**How many photosystem subunits are present in the chromosome?**
1. Code: "grep -c "photosystem" coffee_chloroplast.fasta"
2. The result is 22 photosystem subunits
