1. Move the to scratch folder: cd /scratch_30_day_tmp/wadion
2. Make a new directory for the assignment: mkdir WA_6
3. Move into the new directory: cd WA_6
4. Download the list of proteins from the unknown thermophile: wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/Unk_therm.faa
5. Make a blastable database for those protein sequences: makeblastdb -in Unk_therm.faa -dbtype prot -title Unk_therm.faa
6. Download the hsp.fasta: wget https://github.com/stechtmann/BL4300-5300/raw/master/data/Weekly_Assignment_data/HSP_prot.fasta
7. Run a BLASTP against the unknown thermophile proteins with the hsp.fasta as the query (so, we are using known heat shock proteins from the hsp.fasta file to look for heat shock proteins in the unknown thermophile's protein list): 
8. Please note for these questions that I am using the "Twighlight Zone of protein homology" as a reference and am not selecting anything outside of the safe zone. Also nothing with an E value above 1.00e-10 will be considered
9. (1) How many HSPs were found in the unknown organism?: Six putative heat shock proteins: Unk_30, Unk_31, Unk_1842, Unk_1860, Unk_1970, Unk_1985
10. (2) Provide your justification for how many HSPs were in the organism (use information in the BLAST ouput E-value, length, percent ID, etc)
  10.a (Unk_30): Looks great - 62% identity with an alignment length of 537 bp. The E value is alsogood at 0.0
  10.b (Unk_31): Looks great - 59% identity with a length of 92 bp. The E value is good at 5.53e-34
  10.c (Unk_1842): Looks great - 42% identity with an alignment length of 559 bp. The E value is good at 1.57e-139
  10.d (Unk_1860): Looks okay - 31% identity with an alignment length of 120 is good, the E value is also good at 2.20e-14
  10.e (Unk_1970): Looks great - 33% identity with an alignment length of 625 bp and an E value of 1.76e-54 
  10.f (Unk_1985): Looks okay - 32% identity and an alignment length of 123 bp checks out, there is also an E value of 6.01e-17
11. (3) How many HSP have paralogs?: Two - Unk_1985 and Unk 1860 are paralogs
12. (4) Provide a justification for the presence of paralogs:
